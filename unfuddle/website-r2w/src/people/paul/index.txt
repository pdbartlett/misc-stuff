About me
********

I'm now a software development manager, but in my coding days mainly used C++ and Java, and still play with just about
any language (including C#, Ruby, Python and Scheme) in my "spare" time. The following sections go into a bit more detail...

CV / Resume
***********

When it's done, you'll be able to browse the online version of my CV_.

Blogging / online
*****************

I (semi-)actively maintain a weblog called `Paul's Imaginary Friend`_ (thanks again to Ryan_ for allowing me "in"),
supposedly on .NET development issues but often on more general development or other things entirely. It leads a bit of
a double life, sometimes thinking it's a bliki_. Until this site is properly up and running then that's probably the
best place to go.

In additon, the following are all obsolete or experimental ones, included here mainly to give some pointers as to places
where you can start blogging relatively easily:

- my `original weblog`_, now obsolete, with `blogger.com`_ (now part of Google_)
- `Paul's Beta Space`_ as an experiment with `MSN Spaces`_
- another experiment_, this time with `Yahoo! 360`_

I also use a few "social" websites, such as CodeProject_, del.icio.us_, Flickr_, FriendsReunited_, linkedin_ and SuprGlu_.

Writing
~~~~~~~

In addition to my blog posts_ I have also written a few longer "articles" there, though these mainly take the form of
lists_ of useful free software.

I have also written a couple of "real" articles for CodeProject_, though:

- `Article One`_: Wrapper classes using C++ decorator templates
- `Article Two`_: JsGrep - an OO-ish implementation of grep in JScript

Code
~~~~

My current projects_ have their own section, which is coming along - slowly!

I also have various code samples floating around. Some of these are already online (e.g. accompanying the CodeProject_
articles mentioned above) and others yet to be published. I've started to bring these together on this site to give
examples of using the various languages and technologies I've worked and/or played with - see the `code samples`_
section for what I've managed to do so far.

Other interests
***************

In no particular order:

- genealogy
- PS2 gaming (esp. Gran Turismo 4)
- reading, technical and otherwise
- watching football (Southampton), rugby (Bath) and cricket (Hampshire)
- anything my daughter is into (currently GT4, so that's a bonus)
