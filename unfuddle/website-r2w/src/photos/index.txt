What a picture, what a photograph...
------------------------------------

I've been rather better at taking photos than uploading them, so at present we've
only got two small sets uploaded, both at `Yahoo! Photos`_:

- `Early Sophie`_ - Sophie_ between 0 and 3 months
- Miscellaneous_ - a few oddities I had around one day and uploaded

Hopefully I'll get my act together soon, though, and get rather more of our recent
ones uploaded, and maybe even some older ones scanned and uploaded.
