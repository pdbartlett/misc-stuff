      <p>Welcome to the family website of Paul, Rosie and Sophie Bartlett.</p>
      <p>I'm afraid it's a bit "light" on content at the moment, but hopefully that should change soon...</p>

      <title>About</title>
      <section>
        <title>Purpose</title>
	<p>Not entirely sure yet, but current ideas for its contents are:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>a little about ourselves</li>
	  <li>some of our photos, and links to those hosted elsewhere</li>
	  <li>links to other sites that we are involved with in some way</li>
	</ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Technical</title>
	<p>For those of you that "just have to know", the site is:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>hosted by <a href="http://www.telewest.co.uk/websales/service.do?id=2">blueyonder</a>;</li>
	  <li>generated by <a href="http://forrest.apache.org/">Apache Forrest</a>; and</li>
	  <li>and deployed with Matt Hawley's <a href="http://www.eworldui.net/unleashit/">Unleash It!</a> tool.</li>
