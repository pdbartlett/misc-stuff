      <title>Blogging</title>
      <p>My main <a href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/pdbartlett/">'blog</a> is on the <a href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/">GeekDojo</a> site, the articles
      being mainly concerned with software development in general, and .NET in particular, plus anything else that occurs to me.</p>
      <p>However, I also have the following for historic and/or experimentation reasons:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>An <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/pdbartlett/">experimental 'blog</a> on <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/">MSN Spaces</a></li>
	<li>An <a href="http://pdbartlett.blogspot.com/">old version</a> of my current 'blog, but using <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a></li>
